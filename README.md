Ladies and gentleman, everything comes to an end. This is it. Thank you for being with us. But the second half, would come in music. Hope you will all be back with us, for the third half, and fourth half, and many many more halves. This is what I have to offer, some laughs, some smile, some giggles, sneezes, snores, coughs, hicupps, blowing noses. But once in a while, a 
handkerchief comes out, to wipe tear away from laughter. That's my reward. The rest goes to the government.
